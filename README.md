This is my mock sprint review and retrospective for a company called ChadaTech.
When using a Agile methodology it is important to develop in a adaptive and responsive way to customer feedback.
Customer feedback can be used to create a catalog of user stories.
These user stories are invaluable as they decide the focus and direction of future development.
When developing a program it is essential to provide funtional code each increment.
In the future I will give continuous attention to technical quality and good design in each increment of code I develop.
I will also adapt a empirical process creating code with frequent adaptions and inspections.
Characteristics of a good developer are honesty, open communication, self-organization, and a crossfunctional skillset.
This means as a exemplary team member I am expected to be self-reliant through a crossfunctional skillset and be a team player with open and honest dialogue with my team.
